<u>Ranking System based on Ghost Player ranks</u>:<p />
from:  <a href="https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/describe.cc#L4661"></a><p />

The player starts as a "weakling".<p />
After their first melee style win, they get the level "amateur"<p />
Novice is for a win with a Ranged-style unique<p />
Journeyman is for a win with a hybrid-style unique<p />
Adept is for a win with a mage-style unique<p />
<p />
as for the titles    "veteran",    "master",    "legendary", they can be of later use.<p />

<p />
<b>Qs</b><p />
<li>is it possible to just win a mage-style unique to get the "Adept" rank?</li>
