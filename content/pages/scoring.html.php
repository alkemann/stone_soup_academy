<h4>Ranking System based on Ghost Player ranks</h4>:
taken from:  <a href="https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/describe.cc#L4661">https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/source/describe.cc#L4661</a><p />

The player starts as a "weakling".<p />
After their first melee style win, they get the level "amateur"<p />
"Novice" is for a win with a Ranged-style unique<p />
"Journeyman" is for a win with a hybrid-style unique<p />
"Adept" is for a win with a mage-style unique<p />
<p />
(as for the titles    "veteran",    "master",    "legendary", they can be of later use._<p />

<p />
<b>Qs</b><p />
<li>is it possible to just win a mage-style unique to get the "Adept" rank?</li>
