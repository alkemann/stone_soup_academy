<h2>Welcome "Weakling"*</h2>
<h4>Do you have dreams of becoming a "Journeyman" or even an "Adept" crawler?</h4>
<p>First, you'll need to win a game to get the title of "Amateur" and then a 2nd win to join the ranks of "Novice". 
<p>But fear not, your dream is the goal of the Cosplay Academy:
<li>To provide you with a structured approach to ease the learning curve while playing fun characters based on Uniques;</li> 
<p>This will also allow you to:</p>
    <li>better compete in the <a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/">weekly Crawl Cosplay Challenge.</a></li>
<p />
<h4>Your first Academy goal</h4>
...is to play one of the "melee brutes" below since they are considered to be "easier".</p>
<p>Once you have won a game, <a href="/submit">Submit your Morque</a> to gain access to your next Unique's mission</a>. 
    You'll also be added to the <a href="/scoreboard">Honour Roll</a> allowing you to see also the accomplishment of other crawlers.</p>
<p>If you are fairly new to DCSS, the following character guides should be very helpful.</p>
