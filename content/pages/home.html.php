<h2>Welcome Crawler,
<p>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to become a certified with the Crawl Cosplay Academy.
<p>While doing so, you'll play fun combos as you learn to survive longer...and hopefully win a game sooner than later.
<p>So buckle up with Crawl Cosplay Academy as:
<li>we provide you with a structured approach to ease the learning curve while playing fun characters based on 
    <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unique_monster">DCSS Uniques</a>.</li> 
<p>This will also allow you to:</p>
    <li>better compete in the weekly <a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a>.</li>

<h4>Ready? Set, GO!</h4>
Your first Academy goal is to play one of the "melee brutes" listed below since they are considered to be <b><i>easier</i></b> of their category.</p>
<p>Once you have a "good" game, <a href="/submit">Submit your Morque</a> to gain access to porfolio</a>.
<p>You'll also be added to the <a href="/scoreboard">Honour Roll</a> allowing you to see also the accomplishment of other crawlers.</p>
<p>If you are fairly new to DCSS, the following character guides should be very helpful.</p>
