<h2>Welcome Crawler!</h2>
<p><img src="/img/Snorg.png" style="float:right">Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to become certified with the Crawl Cosplay Academy (CCA).
While doing so, you'll play fun combos as you learn to survive longer, and hopefully win many games sooner than later. 
So buckle up with <abbr title="Crawl Cosplay Academy">CCA</abbr> as we provide you with a structured approach to ease the learning curve 
while playing characters based on <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Unique_monster">DCSS Uniques</a> such as our maskot: Snorg.
<h4>Ready?</h4>
Want to know more before jumping in? See the <a href="/about">About</a> section.
<h4>Set, GO!</h4>
Your first Academy goal is to play one of the "melee brutes" listed below since they are considered to be the <b><i>easier</i></b> combos of the easiest category.</p>
<p>Once you have completed one of your better games, <a href="/submit">Submit your Morque</a> to gain access to your porfolio</a>.
<p>If you are fairly new to DCSS, the following character guides should be very helpful.</p>
