<p>As a <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Troll">Troll</a> <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Berserker">Berzerker</a> (TrBe), you'll be
starting with only 3 levels of INT. This isn't much of an issue during the early game but could require some INT investment come mid-game 
if no equipment or jewelery boosts your INT.</p>

add: How to deal with Hydras!!!
