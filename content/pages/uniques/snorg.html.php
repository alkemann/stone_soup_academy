<h2>Character Guide</h2>
<p>As a <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Troll">Troll</a> <a href="http://crawl.chaosforge.org/Berserker">Berzerker</a> (TrBe),
	you'll be starting with only 3 levels of INT. This isn't much of an issue during the early game but could require some INT 
	investment come mid-game if no equipment or jewelery boosts your INT.</p>
