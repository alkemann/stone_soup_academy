<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><i>Once a king infamous for waging bloodthirsty campaigns, Asterion was exiled to the depths of the
dungeon for his crimes. Here he lurks in his tattered finery, dreaming of a new kingdom. In his lust for power, the minotaur king turned
to the worship of Makhleb, and Makhleb has rewarded him with horrifying destructive might.</i></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
