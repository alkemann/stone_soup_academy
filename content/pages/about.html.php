<h2>About Cosplay Academy</h2>
The Crawl CosPlay Academy (CCA) is intended as a prequel to the weekly 
<a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit the CCC website">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a> (CCC)...and yet, on its own, it is so much more.
As a prequel, it's for players who don't feel they have the skills necessary yet to compete in the Crawl Cosplay Challenge at a level that isn't just beginner.
In general though, the audience is <abbr title="Dungeon Craw: Stone Soup">DCSS</abbr> players who are fairly new to the game or haven't won at least 5 games with each of the different styled combos.

<h4>Certification Process</h4>
After you complete a good game (with either a win or <abbr title="Yet Another Sad Death">YASD</abbr>), you submit your morgue to track your progress.
If you did not win the game, you get assigned a ghost XL title from the following:
<br><br>
<table>
  <tr><th>XL</th><th>Title</th></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp3</td><td>Weakling</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp6</td><td>Amateur</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp9</td><td>Novice</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td><td>Journeyman</td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td><td>Adept</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td><td>Veteran</td></tr>
  <tr><td>21</td><td>Master</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24+</td><td>Legendary</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
When you do win with 1 Unique's combo, you'll be awarded the Bronze Certification for that playstyle.
With a 2nd win with a different Unique's combo from the same playstyle, you'll be awarded the Silver Certification.
And again a 3rd win will grant you the Gold Certification.
There are 5 playstyles:
Melee Weapon, Ranged Weapon, Hybrid, Magic, and "special ops".
The last category is for popular combos that don't fit well in the previous four categories.
-- under construction --
  <p>You'll also be added to the <a href="/scoreboard">Honour Roll</a> allowing you to see also the accomplishment of other crawlers.</p>

Once you are certified, you feel ready to compete at an intermediate level in the weekly 
<a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a>.
