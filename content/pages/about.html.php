<h2>About Cosplay Academy</h2>
The Crawl CosPlay Academy (CCA) is intended as a prequel to the weekly 
<a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit the CCC website">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a> (CCC)...and yet, 
on its own, it is so much more.
As a prequel, it's for players who don't feel they have the skills necessary yet to compete in the Crawl Cosplay Challenge at a level
that isn't just beginner.
In general though, the audience is <abbr title="Dungeon Craw: Stone Soup">DCSS</abbr> players who are fairly new to the game or 
haven't won at least 4 games with each of the different styled characters.

<h2>Process</h2>
After you complete a good game (with either a win or <abbr title="Yet Another Sad Death">YASD</abbr>), you <a href="/submit">Submit your Morgue</a> to track your progress.
If you did not win the game, you get assigned a ghost XL title from the following:
<br><br>
<table>
  <tr><th>XL</th><th>Title</th></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp3</td><td>Weakling</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp6</td><td>Amateur</td></tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp9</td><td>Novice</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td><td>Journeyman</td></tr>
  <tr><td>15</td><td>Adept</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18</td><td>Veteran</td></tr>
  <tr><td>21</td><td>Master</td></tr>
  <tr><td>24+</td><td>Legendary</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
When you do win with 1 Unique's combo, you'll be awarded the Bronze Certification for that playstyle.
With a 2nd win with a different Unique's combo from the same playstyle, you'll be awarded the Silver Certification.
And again a 3rd win will grant you the Gold Certification.
There are 4 playstyles with 3 uniques each:
<a href="/melee">Melee Weapons</a>, 
<a href="/ranged">Ranged Weapons</a>, 
<a href="hybrid">Hybrid</a>, and
<a href="magic">Magic</a>.

Here's an example of a fictional player profile:

<table>
  <tr><th>Category</th><th>Level</th><th>Accomplishment</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Melee</td><td>GOLD certified</td><td>3 wins with each melee Unique</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ranged</td><td>BRONZE certified</td><td>1 win with a ranged Unique</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Hybrid</td><td>SILVER certified</td><td>2 wins with different hybrid Uniques</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Magic</td><td>Journeyman</td><td>no win yet but reached XL 15-17</td></tr>
</table>

-- under construction --
  <p>Once you have a win, you'll also be added to the <a href="/certified">Certification Wall</a> allowing you to see also the accomplishment of other crawlers.</p>

Once you are certified, you'll likely feel ready to compete at an intermediate level in the weekly 
<a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a>.
