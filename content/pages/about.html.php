<h2>About Cosplay Academy</h2>
Crawl's CosPlay Academy (CCA) is a prequel to the weekly 
<a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit the CCC website">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a> (CCC).
<p>The intended audience is DCSS players who are fairly new to the game or haven't won at least 4 games with each of the different styled combos.
It's also for players who don't feel they have the skills necessary yet to compete in the Crawl Cosplay Challenge at a level that isn't just beginner.

<h3>Certification Process</h3>
As you complete a game with either a win or YASD, you submit your morgue to track your progress.
If you did not win the game, you get assigned a ghost XL title from the following:

<table>
  <tr><th>XL</th><th>Title</th></tr>
  <tr><th> 3</th><th>Weakling</th></tr>
  <tr><th> 6</th><th>Amateur</th></tr>
  <tr><th> 9</th><th>Novice</th></tr>
  <tr><th>12</th><th>Journeyman</th></tr>
  <tr><th>15</th><th>Adept</th></tr>
  <tr><th>18</th><th>Veteran</th></tr>
  <tr><th>21</th><th>Master</th></tr>
  <tr><th>24+</th><th>Legendary</th></tr>
<table>

-- under construction --
  <p>You'll also be added to the <a href="/scoreboard">Honour Roll</a> allowing you to see also the accomplishment of other crawlers.</p>

Once you are certified, you will be ready to compete at an intermediate level in the weekly <a href="http://www.crawlcosplay.com/">Crawl Cosplay Challenge</a>.
